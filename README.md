[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/slatherin/kevin-module-server.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/slatherin/kevin-module-server)

A ratings &amp; reviews component for a marketplace product page. Developed for my Front-End Capstone project at Hack Reactor. 

Each member on our dev team selected a component to reproduce from Amazon's product page and developed it independently as a microservice. We rendered them all together through a proxy server and deployed them independent AWS EC2 instances.
